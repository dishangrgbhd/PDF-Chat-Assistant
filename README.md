 # üìÑüí¨ PDF Chat Assistant using Agentic RAG
**Conversational Chatbot with PDF Assistance capabilities.**


This project is an intelligent chatbot assistant that allows users to **chat naturally**, **ask questions about a PDF paper(it can be a research paper or PDF related to laws or an academic material)**, also providing the functionality to **generate summaries related to that PDF**, all in a single interface. It's built with:

- **LangGraph** (to orchestrate memory and tool-based flows)
- **LangChain** (LCEL for retrieval + summarization)
- **LangSmith** (for tracing tool calls, LLM prompts, and debugging) 
- **Groq Llama3** (for blazing-fast LLM responses)
- **Streamlit** (for frontend deployment)
